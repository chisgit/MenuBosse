# Copilot Instructions (GitHub Copilot Agent)

## System Path and CLI Rules
- Ensure `C:\Users\User` is included in the system PATH for CLI tools like `acli.exe`.
- When working with CLI tools, check `.clinerules` for additional agent instructions and rules.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Tag all updates in `plan.md` and other documentation with the agent name (e.g., "github copilot") for traceability.
- When updating documentation, clearly state which agent performed the update.

## .clinerules Integration
- Always check `.clinerules` for further instructions before performing actions, especially when collaborating with other agents.
- If `.clinerules` is updated, re-read and apply new rules immediately.
