DO NOT EVER remove existing functionality unless explicitly asked to do so.
DO NOT EVER randomly remove code or comments because you think you're cool
DO NOT EVER introduce any breaking changes EVER EVER
Write Unit tests as part of your BEST CODING PRACTICE so you know what's working and what isn't without having to ask me like an idiot
ALWAYS UPDATE the plan when you complete and tests have passed by ME
