## Cline Instructions

1. Always read `plan.md` on every chat request.
   - Before responding, check the latest contents of `plan.md`.
   - Use instructions and context from `plan.md` to guide all responses.

2. Continue to build and update this instructions file.
   - Extend and refine instructions as new requirements arise.
   - Ensure all changes are modular and decoupled for reuse by other agents.
   - Always perform a web search to confirm official conventions for filenames, locations, or standards when asked.
   - Always use PowerShell for Windows syntax for terminal commands unless a web search finds that services (e.g., Netlify, Render) require otherwise.
   - Do not use '&' in PowerShell commands; ensure all file manipulations use PowerShell syntax.
   - If needed, create a local MCP server and tool to handle all file and PowerShell terminal tasks, allowing focus on higher-level logic.
   - Use the MCP server and terminal tool for all terminal and file management operations to ensure correct PowerShell syntax (no '&') and proper command execution.

3. Cater responses to user needs.
   - Follow all instructions in `plan.md` and this file.
   - Prioritize clarity, modularity, and best practices.

4. Testing and Validation
   - Write unit tests for any logic or code changes.
   - Validate that instructions are followed correctly.
